This is a simple library to get a handle on new process starts. The implementation is kept very simple. Other ways to get process starts are WMI or a kernel driver.
For the driver [PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutine) method can be used.
